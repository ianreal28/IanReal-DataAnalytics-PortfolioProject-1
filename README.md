# Retail Sales Analysis Project (Excel & Power BI) by Ian Wendell Real
This is my first portfolio data analytics project. It includes data cleaning to data visualization. I've used ChatGPT for generating a raw data set, Excel for data cleaning, and Power BI for visualization.
## Before everything, here are the tools that I've used to make this project
- ChatGPT (For generating a raw data set)
- Microsoft Excel (For data cleaning & pivot tables)
- Power BI (For visualization)
## Dataset used
This raw dataset is generated by ChatGPT.

## Data Cleaning
*Please refer to the Raw Dataset*
1. Removed duplicate data
2. The **Gender** Column has blank values. There are 3 major values: *Male, Female, Other*. I've replaced the blank values with *"Unknown"* to avoid misclassification.
3. As observed, the **Country** Column also has blank values. I've also replaced the blank values with *"Unknown"* to preserve the data, as Country is very important in this analysis
4. The **PaymentMethod** column also has missing values. Replacing it with *"Unknown"* to preserve the data.
5. Fixed the *"-300"* value in the **UnitPrice** column. It appears to be an error. As we can see, the Raw data shows that the **total** of the row is *-1200* and the quantity is *4*
6. The **Product** column also has blank values. I've also replaced it with *"Other"* to preserve the data
7. As we can see, the *UnitPrice* column has blanks. I've created a separate column and imputed the missing values by using *group-level Median* by **Product**
8. For the **Quantity** column. We can see that there are 93 *zero* values and 99 *Blank* values, and all of them have no totals, so we can't calculate them back. In the real world, I would confirm this with the business to just represent this as *"Error" or "Invalid Transaction"* or to just drop these rows, as this data is unusable for analysis. For this Time, I'm going to drop these invalid rows.
9. For the **Total** column. There are also errors and miscalculated values. Since the **Quantity** and **UnitPrice** columns were fixed. I've calculated it using **PRODUCT** to get the totals
10. In **CustomerID**, we can see that there is one blank value. I simply flagged it as *CustUnknown1* to keep the data
11. In the **Age** column, there are also blank values and one outlier, which is *"150"*, which I considered invalid. In this case, there is only 1.3% of missing/invalid data, and I've imputed it by using *group-level Median* by **Gender**
12. In the last part of cleaning, I've moved the recalculated values to the original column, and after that, I've deleted the recalculated columns.

## Pivot Tables
*Please refer to the image below*
1. The first pivot table, Revenue by Product
2. The second one is Revenue by Country
3. The third is about the payment method distribution
4. The fourth one is about which age group spends the most. In order to do this, I've created another column named **AgeGroup** for ***Binning*** using the ***IFS function***
5. The fifth pivot table shows the numbers of each payment method used by gender
6. The sixth pivot table shows again the numbers of each payment method used by country

## Data Visualization
1. In getting data in Power BI, I've imported the **CLEANED** table from the Excel that I've worked on.
2. Before proceeding, I've transformed the data via Power Query to check errors. And it seems it has in the **CustomerID** column. Since I've replaced the name of the blank **CustomerID** with *"CustUnknown1"*, I've changed the *data type* of it to **Text** to avoid error.
3. Once it has been cleaned and no error shows up, I've applied it and proceeded to Power BI for visualization.
4. In the first visualization, I've created a *Stacked Column Chart* to show the revenue per product.
5. The second one is the *Map* to show the sales by country.
6. The third is the payment method used via the *Donut Chart*.
7. The fourth one is the stacked bar chart, and it shows the sales of each age group that I've binned previously in Excel.
8. The fifth one shows sales revenue per month through a *Line Chart* where each line represents a different year.
9. The next one is I've created a **slicer** for *Year* and *Gender*.
10. The last one is a *Card* for the current selected gender and year, and I've created a **Measure** and used ***DAX*** for a specific formula so that every time the slicer selects, a specific value will show on each card, respectively.
